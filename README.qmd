# Enhancing the ability to tell where acute malnutrition is of concern: a spatial interpolation using PPS-based survey data  

Acute malnutrition is a life-threatening and devastating disease of epidemic 
proportions worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, affecting
mostly children under the age of five. 

To effectively fight this public health issue, acute malnutrition programs require
approaches that use the limited resources to put in place targeted interventions 
that meet efficiently- and effectively the population's needs. One approach to 
that end involves knowing and understanding the spatial or geographic variation 
of acute malnutrition.

This repository contains an R implementation of a spatial data analysis that is 
aimed at identifying locations in the area of analysis where acute malnutrition 
is of concern by predicting it from sampled areas to unsampled ones. 

## Research questions: 

+ Does spatial interpolation produce reliable (precise and accurate) estimates 
using small scale survey data, such as district level surveys?
 
If yes:  

+ How comparable the predicted estimates can be against the observed prevalence 
estimates of the original survey results?

## Study area
Al Fasher, North Darfur, Sudan

# Repository structure 
+ `data/`
+ `report/`
+ `scripts/`

# Reproducibility information  
The repository was created in `R` version 4.4.2. This project uses the `{renv}` framework to record R package dependencies and versions. Packages and versions used are recorded in `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in `renv/` and other files in the root project directory. On starting an `R` session in the working directory, run `renv::restore()` to install R package dependencies.

## Data encryption 
This project uses `{cyphr}` to encrypt the raw data that lives in `data-raw/` directory. In order to be able to access and decrypt the encrypted data, the user will need to have created their own personal SSH key and make a request to be added to the project. An easy-to-grasp guide on how to make a request will be found [here](https://github.com/OxfordIHTM/cyphr-encryption-demonstration#).
