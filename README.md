# Enhancing the ability to tell where acute malnutrition is of concern: a spatial interpolation using PPS-based survey data

Acute malnutrition is a life-threatening and devastating disease of
epidemic proportions worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income
countries, affecting mostly children under the age of five.

To effectively fight this public health issue, acute malnutrition
programs require approaches that use the limited resources to put in
place targeted interventions that meet efficiently- and effectively the
population’s needs. One approach to that end involves knowing and
understanding the spatial or geographic variation of acute malnutrition.

This repository contains an R implementation of a spatial data analysis
that is aimed at identifying locations in the area of analysis where
acute malnutrition is of concern by predicting it from sampled areas to
unsampled ones.

## Research questions:

- Does spatial interpolation produce reliable (precise and accurate)
  estimates using small scale survey data, such as district level
  surveys?

If yes:

- How comparable the predicted estimates can be against the observed
  prevalence estimates of the original survey results?
